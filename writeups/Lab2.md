# Lab 2

This lab serves to establish communication between a computer and the Artemis through Bluetooth. For the Python portion, a Jupyter lab is used; and the Artemis is programmed through the Arduino IDE. 

### Prelab

#### Setup steps:
1. Installed a virtual environment using 'venv'.
2. Activated the environment using the command 'source FastRobots_ble/bin/activate'.
3. Install the following packages: 'numpy' 'pyyaml' 'colorama' 'nest_asyncio' 'bleak' 'jupyterlab'.
4. Download the codebase found [here](https://cornell.box.com/s/aivj9ad3uv74lmpvxz8s64aamgz6azt1).
5. Start the Jupyter Lab server.
6. Install ArduinoBLE from the library manager. After burning the code on the Artemis, it should publish its MAC address.

#### Codebase
The Artemis communicates with the computer through a Bluetooth protocol. The MAC address corresponding to the Artemis is queried when trying to connect. Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) helps differentiate the type of data to be sent between the Artemis and computer. UUIDs can be generated using python and must match UUIDs specidied in the Arduino files.
We were provided with demonstration code to verify connection and performance.
