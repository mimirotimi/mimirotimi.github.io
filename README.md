### My name is Rotimi Adetunji and I am an MEng BME student. I did my undergrad at the University of Pittsburgh in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I have an interest in robotic systems, ranging from medical robots to autonomous vehicles. I am hoping to work in either of those industries after graduation although I am leaning more towards AVs.
