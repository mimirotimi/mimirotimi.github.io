<img src = "Headshot2022.jpg" width = "500">

### My name is Rotimi Adetunji and I am an MEng BME student. I did my undergrad at the University of Pittsburgh in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I have an interest in robotic systems, ranging from medical robvots to autonomous vehicles. I am hoping to work in either of those industries after graduation although I am leaning more towards AVs.
